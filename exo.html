							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Design and development of lower body exoskeleton which aims at helping human
								beings suffering with paraplegia (form of lower body paralysis). The exoskeleton imitates the
								human gait cycle, the pattern in which a human walk to motivate rehabilitation of people with
								this form of disability. The exoskeleton developed in present study has an aluminum
								body/frame and all the joints are actuated as required to give motion to the structure. Joints
								used in exoskeleton involve a reduction gear assembly for torque multiplication, resulting in a
								higher output torque. Flexible coupling utilized to transmit the motion of the actuator to the
								reduction gear assembly. Actuators involved are DC planetary geared motors controlled by
								motor driver and the code compiled on Arduino IDE. Actuators and controller powered by
								rechargeable Lead Acid battery of rated output voltage of 12 Volts and a battery rating of 10
								Amp-hr. All the current carrying wires, well insulated with proper tubing enhancing safety of
								the operator, additional safety features include knee locking mechanism to resist any adverse
								knee movement. An emergency off button placed to stop supply of power in case of any
								mishap. Leather cushion provided for comfort and Velcro straps used to fasten the exoskeleton
								to the human user, painting and polishing done to make the exoskeleton aesthetically appealing.
								</p>
							<p>Fabrication of the exoskeleton involved various production processes namely drilling, bending,
								cutting, grinding, tapping, turning and riveting. All the above processes were performed within
								acceptable production accuracy. To make the exoskeleton follow required human gait cycle,
								suitable algorithm was developed and implemented in controller memory. The developed
								exoskeleton was tested and it successfully mimics gait cycle.</p>
