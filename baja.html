							<p>The main goal of BAJA SAEINDIA has always been to develop a fresh and curious mind's understanding to enter the industrial field.
								The goal is to help college students expand their  technical and practical reach, activate the prefrontal cortex, and increase planning and problem-solving skills, improve management, as well as basic technical knowledge.
							</p>
							<p>
								The philosophy hasn't changed since the event's inception in 2007 - teams should always build a simple off-road vehicle for fun, aesthetics and ergonomics, while remaining a fun machine. Fun and durable under real-world conditions.
								Students had to pass the Virtual Baja preliminary round presenting their model design, followed by a virtual dynamic event that included their completed virtual model. 
								and  physical events, with tracking failure performance evaluation.
							</p>
							<p>	
								Teams are judged on six key parameters during the Virtual BAJA event - their knowledge of the rule, vehicle design, project plan,  design methodology, and  design review plan. next.
								A total of 400 points were spent designing each team, and around top 120 teams are selected every year to compete in the main event.
							</p>
							<p>	
								Buggies are evaluated based on a variety of factors such as cost, aesthetics, and manufacturing quality, as part of a static assessment.
								The business event then gets underway, which shows just how creative and commercial the teams are. There are also many dynamic tests such as acceleration, braking, and terrain handling to evaluate the mountain bike produced.
								But none of these tests are harsher than an endurance race, where riders and carts are pushed to their limits until a winner emerges.
